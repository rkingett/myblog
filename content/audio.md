## My podcast.

[My podcast called Sightless Scribbles](https://weirdwritings.pinecast.co/) has my blog posts narrated for people that cannot or choose not to read them. It also has audiobook excerpts, audio recordings of events, and more audio goodies.

While most episodes are open for everyone to listen, I do sometimes offer bonus episodes that can only be accessed via a recurring subscription.

[Become a recurring podcast supporter to get all the bonus episodes!](https://tips.pinecast.com/jar/weirdwritings)

I do pay human narrators so [I need financial support to continue paying narrators](/support)

## Video.

I am not a video person. With me being blind, [I gravitate to my podcast more than video,](https://weirdwritings.pinecast.co/) but I still offer some video things from time to time.

All of my videos are hosted on PeerTube. [browse all videos on PeerTube](https://spectra.video/a/weirdwriter/videos) or [narrow down videos by playlists.](https://spectra.video/c/robertkingett/video-playlists)

My video offerings can also work in all podcast apps as well. [Just stick this video RSS feed in your favorite podcast app and it should play the video.](https://spectra.video/feeds/videos.xml?accountId=400558)
