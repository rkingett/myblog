[Listen to A Field Guide to the Personal Space Violations of Public Transit](https://weirdwritings.pinecast.co/episode/22b7a0fd/a-field-guide-to-the-personal-space-violations-of-public-transit)

Public transit is a marvel of modern engineering and a complete failure of human social design. It is a rolling testament to our species’ profound inability to be aware of anyone but ourselves. As a daily commuter, I have become an unwilling naturalist, documenting the various species of sensory offenders in their native habitat.

Welcome to my field guide.

Species 1: The Headphone Bleeder (Tinnitus percussivus)

This specimen believes that sharing is caring, especially when it comes to their terrible taste in music. They are identifiable by the inescapable, high-frequency tss-tss-tss of a synthesized hi-hat that leaks from their earbuds at a volume capable of sterilizing small mammals. This sound burrows into your skull and takes up residence, leaving you with a phantom beat that will haunt you for hours.

Species 2: The Olfactory Offender (Aroma aggressivus)

Your nose will identify this individual long before your ears do. They travel in a dense, personal cloud of either A) cologne so aggressive it feels like a chemical weapon, or B) the greasy, pungent ghost of a recent fast-food meal. Their presence fundamentally alters the bus's ecosystem, creating a "no-breath zone" with a radius of at least three feet.

Species 3: The Pole Monopolizer (Brachium obstructus)

This is my personal nemesis. You know the central poles on the bus or train? They are meant for multiple humans to use for balance. The Monopolizer, however, sees it as their own personal property. They don't just hold the pole; they embrace it. They wrap their entire arm around it in a full-body hug, creating an impassable barrier of human flesh and entitlement. For someone navigating by touch, this presents a unique challenge: either give up on stability or commit to an act of unwelcome intimacy with a stranger’s unwashed armpit.

Navigating this ecosystem is a daily exercise in sensory warfare. My only comfort is in quiet classification, turning my frustration into a silent, internal documentary narrated by a very tired David Attenborough. It’s that, or start screaming. The documentary is quieter.
