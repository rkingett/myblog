In 2022, I won this very unexpected grant. It arrived at the worst time in my writing career, as well. I was unable to write due to a lot of factors. I even completely forgot I applied to [the PEN America Writers Emergency Fund.](https://pen.org/campaign/pen-america-writers-emergency-fund/)

The grant acceptance was the very unexpected push I needed to get myself back on my feet. I still couldnâ€™t write as much, but still, the grant helped deal with an emergency.

In addition to the funds awarded, I was granted complimentary year-long membership to [PEN America.](https://pen.org/)
