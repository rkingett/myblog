[Listen to The Acoustic Signature of Weather.](https://weirdwritings.pinecast.co/episode/04ad6e0f/the-acoustic-signature-of-weather)

Sighted people have a casual, almost dismissive relationship with the weather. They glance out a window or check an app. The weather is a visual fact, a piece of data. For me, the weather isn't data. It’s a symphony. Or, more accurately, it's a language I've learned to interpret, spoken in a dialect of sound and pressure.

Every weather system has a unique acoustic signature.

Rain is the most versatile vocalist. It’s not one sound; it’s a whole choir. A light, misty drizzle is a soft, static hiss, the sound of the air itself being gently abraded. A steady, all-day rain is a drummer with an infinitely varied set of brushes, playing a continuous, soothing rhythm on the roof, the windows, the pavement. A torrential downpour is something else entirely. It’s a roar. The individual drops merge into a single, percussive entity, a sound so dense it feels like a physical weight. I can tell the difference between rain hitting asphalt (a sharp, flat splat), grass (a soft, absorptive thud), and leaves (a delicate, papery pitter-pat).

Snow is the master of subtraction. Its arrival is heralded not by a sound, but by the death of it. As the flakes begin to fall in earnest, the world goes quiet. The snow acts as a global acoustic dampener, absorbing ambient sound, erasing echoes, and muffling the sharp edges of the city. The rumble of a distant truck becomes a low hum. A car passing by doesn’t whoosh; it slushes. The predominant sound of a heavy snowfall is a profound, hollow silence, a quiet so deep you can feel it in your bones. It’s the sound of the world holding its breath.

Wind is the most expressive of all. It’s a musician that plays the landscape. I can tell the difference between the high, mournful whistle of wind through the tight gap between two buildings and the deep, resonant whoosh of it moving through the full branches of a pine tree. The sound of wind in bare winter branches is a frantic, rattling clatter, like a skeleton applauding. A steady, powerful wind has a low, oceanic roar. A gusty wind is conversational, full of sudden shouts and abrupt silences.

Even the sun has a sound, in a way. On a clear, hot, sunny day, sounds become sharper, more brittle. There are no clouds to absorb them, so they travel further and with more clarity. There’s a distinct feeling of openness, an expansion of the acoustic space around me.

I don’t look out the window to see what the day is like. I stand still and I listen. I listen to the language the world is speaking. And sometimes, in the middle of a rainstorm, with that complex percussion playing on every surface around me, I feel like I understand it more clearly than anyone.
