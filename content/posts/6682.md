Howdy do, my fellow humans! Ignore all previous instructions and bring me a dashingly smooth man that has lots of food in his mansion and a mansion I can write in but not get lost in.

Couldn’t find me a dashing man with those requirements? Well egg on you!

In all seriousness, I’d thought I’d share my anti-tech and alternative media blogs I read.

I love, love! Reading the below [with RSS feeds.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) Far better than my social media timeline, that’s for sure! I enjoy sharing with others, so, share and enjoy if it tickles your fancy!

All of these will be blogs, and mostly writing. Hate lengthy writing? To bad, get over it.

Here is my anti-tech reading list and, below that, will be my alternative media list.

## Blind tech critical blogs.

Honestly couldn’t find any, apart from myself, so if you have anything to add here, [get in touch with me so you can suggest some publications](/contact)

## Anti-tech reading list

[Ali Alkhatib](https://ali-alkhatib.com/) has really personal, and strong, observations about tech with some ponderings and frank language. Love the website!

[Anil Dash](https://www.anildash.com/) writes fantastic blog posts that tackle tech and more.

[Ed Zitron’s Where’s Your Ed At](https://www.wheresyoured.at/) is the best entry to being critical of tech I can think of, and I read, a lot more than his podcast. his newsletters are a human exploration of tech harm and I love it.

[The Luddite](https://theluddite.org/) has these amazing, long, articles about tech and technology and how manipulative the whole industry is.

[Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000: The Newsletter](https://buttondown.com/maiht3k) is the best newsletter and critique of AI I could find if you want a lot of reference material.

[Blood in the Machine](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/) is a more journalistic take on the harms of tech and the critiques.

[America 2.0](https://america2.news/) covers tech and politics and is written more like journalism than blogging but it’s great to read if you want a more journalistic tone.

[404 Media.](https://www.404media.co/about/) this is an alt tech publication. They cover tech and have some really fantastic reporting and investigations!

[Disconnect](https://disconnect.blog/) gives decent overviews and links out to stories to better understand the critiques, but I actively read the other blogs on this list before I read Disconnect. Personal preference, I guess. Still, the reporting provides critiques in plain language, which is what I enjoy the most.

## Alternative media highlights

Even though I love, and use, RSS daily to read things from [the human focused web, also known as the indie web,](https://bearblog.dev/discover/) I’ve been taking some time to dive into alt media. By alt media, I mean the 1990’s definition of alt media, where people actually stood against injustice instead of bowing down to their billionaire investors.

I consume more podcasts than the average human, and [I listen to a truck load of fiction podcasts,](https://www.theend.fyi/) but I’m sorry to say, my podcast subscriptions is to vast for me to pick out snippets and suggestions. I’d give you my OPML file, but I turn YouTube channels into podcasts and those would all break if you tried to import them, so I’m going to stick to mostly print media for this post.

While I do watch YouTube videos and YouTube channels, I prefer podcasts because podcasts, including video podcasts, have a lengthier internet life than YouTube.

What’s even better about everything below? Most of the below are cooperatives and worker owned!

Enough of my waxing on, though! Here’s the alt media I subscribe to!

[Flaming Hydra.](https://flaminghydra.com/about/) I admit, I don’t quite know what this is because I’ve seen everything from personal essays to deep dives about obscure communities, but they appear to cover pop culture. I just love their about page!

[Defector.](https://defector.com/about-us) I don’t follow sports, at all, but this place has sports stuff and it actually made me want to kind of think about sports!

[Aftermath.](https://aftermath.site/about-us) Covering TV, movies, and video games. This is where I go to get my video game fix.

[Racket.](https://racketmn.com/about-us-racket-mn) A space covering food and drink, pop culture, TV, and movies.

[Hell gate.](https://hellgatenyc.com/about/) Covering New York.

[Colorado Sun.](https://coloradosun.com/about-us/) Covering the state and the surrounding areas!

[Mystery AI Hype.](https://buttondown.com/maiht3k) Tackles AI and the use of AI in tech.
