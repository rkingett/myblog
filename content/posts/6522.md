But when Robert Kingett stepped out onto the dating scene, he faced a whole host of additional challenges as a gay man living with blindness, cerebral palsy, and a speech impediment. Pass the Salt details Robert’s time on the dating scene in 2010s Chicago. Get ready to meet the brightest and best from the online dating world, including The Fare Fan, The Smooth Catfish, and the dashing Richard, who’s better company than Robert’s humming fridge. It’s a hilarious and often moving account of his adventures, guaranteed to make you laugh, make you think, and above all, inspire you.
