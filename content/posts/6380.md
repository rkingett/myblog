This story features on-page psychological abuse. Take care of yourself before reading.

## Initial Podcast/audio version.

Our final podcast from [the anthology IT CAME FROM THE COMMENT SECTION!](http://brickmoonentertainment.com/2018/11/07/commentsection/) couldn’t be more appropriate or seasonal.  Typically our writer’s run dark –  maybe that’s just the nature of creating compelling stories.  But every now and then we get a story that’s full of empathy and compassion – a story such as this one from Robert Kingett.  Please enjoy this personal and heartfelt tale that celebrates selflessness and humanity.
