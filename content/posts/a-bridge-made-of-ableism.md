[Listen to A Bridge Made of Ableism](https://weirdwritings.pinecast.co/episode/35b20ee1/a-bridge-made-of-ableism)

The air in the bank was thick with the scent of old money and new anxiety. It's a smell I know well. But today, another element was added to the mix: fear. It wasn't my fear. It was coming from the teller's window, and it was pointed, like a weapon, at a man whose only crime was his refusal to be invisible.

I couldn’t see him, but I could hear him. He was a presence. A tall, solid man, I guessed, from the way his sounds filled the space. He was Deaf and he was trying, with every fiber of his being, to communicate a problem. His sounds were not words. They were a raw, powerful, and deeply human expression of frustration—a series of sharp, guttural noises from deep in his chest. They were the sound of a man trying to tear a hole in the wall of silence that stood between him and the world.

To me, the sounds were a language of pure, unfiltered emotion. They were eloquent.

To the bank teller, they were a threat.

"Sir, you need to calm down," she said, her voice a thin, reedy thing, tight with a fear born of ignorance. "I can't understand you if you're going to be aggressive."

The man's frustrated noises grew louder, a feedback loop of misunderstanding. And then,

A Black security guard I knew well spoke into something.

"We got an agressive Black man here. I'm going to handle this."

I could hear the soft, squeaking soles of his security guard's shoes moving closer. They were going to escalate. They were going to take this man's righteous frustration and label it as violence. They were going to break him rather than try to understand him.

And my own history, the muscle memory of being misunderstood and dismissed, roared to life inside me. Not today. Not on my watch.

I pulled out my phone, my fingers flying across the glass screen with a speed born of long practice. I opened the Notes app. I typed. I maxed out the font size.

Then I stepped forward, into the current of fear.

"Excuse me," I said to the security guard, my voice calm and steady, projecting just enough to cut through the tension. "Give us a minute, would you?"

I tapped the Deaf man on the arm. When he looked towards me, I held my phone up, its screen a silent declaration.

I couldn't see the man's face, but I felt the shift in the room. The angry, frustrated sounds stopped abruptly. There was a pause. A moment of pure, suspended silence. I felt him move closer, felt the warmth of his body as he leaned in to read the screen.

The screen said: **I can help. What do you need? I'm blind but we can type back and forth.**

And then, huge warm hands extracted the phone from my grasp. a new sound. The soft, rapid tapping of his finger on the glass of my phone. He was typing. A bridge had been built between my world of sound and his world of sight. A bridge made of light and text.

His fingers flew, his message appearing beneath mine. **They froze my account. Said fraud. My rent is due today. They won't listen.**

I typed back. **They're scared because they don't understand. Let me be your voice. I can interpret if you type. My ASL is basic and not fluent. I'll type what they say.**

He tapped a single word. **Okay.**

The second security guard had arrived, a heavy presence smelling of starched cotton and authority. "Sir, is there a problem here?"

I turned my head toward the sound of his voice, keeping my phone held high. "There is no problem," I said calmly. "There is a communication barrier. This gentleman's name is Andre, and the bank has frozen his account in error on the day his rent is due. He has been trying to explain this. Now, if you could please get the bank manager, Andre and I will explain it to her together."

The authority in my own voice, amplified by the silent, typed words of my new comrade, changed the equation. The guard hesitated, then nodded.

The manager arrived, her heels clicking with importance. We stood before her, a strange and sudden team. Andre would type his frustration and his facts onto my phone with a speed and precision that was breathtaking. I would then read his words aloud, my voice lending an unwavering, calm weight to his righteous anger. I'd type back what they said, word for word.

I was not his savior. I was his amplifier. I was a human conduit for a voice that was already there, a voice they had refused to hear.

Faced with the undeniable, typed evidence and the calm, clear narration, the manager’s condescension melted into panicked efficiency. There were apologies. Profuse, stammering apologies. The account was unfrozen. The error was "deeply regretted."

As the manager scurried away, Andre took my phone one last time.

**Thank you,** he typed. **They never listen.**

I typed back. **I know. But today, we made them.**

**Want to get some food with me?** He typed. I couldn't resist. Why not!

**That'd be amazing! Let's go. You guide me.**

Even though Orientation and Mobility training always says, grab the elbow, lately, I've been tossing out all social norms and just doing what feels right in the moment. I didn't grab his elbow. I took his hand, then, his large hand enveloping mine in a brief, powerful squeeze. It was a gesture of solidarity, a pact forged in a moment of shared frustration and mutual respect.

We walked out of the bank together, two men who moved through the world in profoundly different ways. But for a few crucial moments, in a cold place that was built to misunderstand us, we had spoken the same language. And our solidarity, together, had been a crescendo of comradery that was a testimony all by itself.
