Book censorship is very, very, important to me, so when I see libraries that directly challenge book censorship, well, I love them!

I’ve [written many times in my blog about why I love libraries](https://robertkingett.com/posts/category/blog/) and detest book censorship. I’m here to promote a free nationwide library for the USA!

[Queer Liberation Library](https://www.queerliberationlibrary.org/) is a digital library that uses the Libby app as their library platform. It’s free for anyone in the US to sign up, so [donate your money to Queer Liberation Library](https://givebutter.com/DLwIaj) or send someone the registration link below.
