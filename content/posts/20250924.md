There is a special kind of terror reserved for the moment a well-meaning, sighted friend says, with a voice beaming with pride, “I got you something! I saw it and thought of you.”

My friend, Lorenzo, is one of the kindest people I know. His heart is a vast, open territory of good intentions. So when he placed a large, shrink-wrapped box in my hands, my face assembled itself into an expression of genuine gratitude.

“Lorenzo, wow,” I said, my voice warm. “You really didn’t have to.”

“I know! But it’s so cool. It’s a board game… for us!”

*Us.* The word hung in the air. My internal monologue, a cynical old man who lives in my chest, immediately sat up and narrowed his eyes. *Here we go.*

The box was smooth and cool. My fingers, doing their work, found the title. It was embossed in large print, and below it, a line of Jumbo Braille. This was the first sign that something was deeply, cosmically wrong. Braille is small. It is precise. The bumps on this box were large, rounded, and spaced with the kind of random abandon a child might use to decorate a cupcake with sprinkles. My fingers traced the line. It was not a language. It was a tactile lie. It was the physical equivalent of someone shouting a string of random vowels at you and calling it French. When my fingers finally deciphered the giant wall of poorly spaced dots, I nearly burst out laughing. Instead of saying the name of the game, the Braille read, “Tactician’s waterfalls sing with bananas.”

*Okay,* my inner cynic grumbled. *So the box was designed by a well-meaning baboon. Let’s see what’s inside.*

Externally, I smiled. “This is so thoughtful, man. Let’s open it.”

I tore off the plastic. Inside, there was a bag of game pieces. I poured them onto the table. They made a light, plastic clatter. I picked one up. It was a smooth, simple cone shape. I picked up another. Also a cone. A third. A fourth. They were all cones. They were identical in size, shape, and texture. They were as distinct from one another as grains of sand.

Lorenzo’s voice, bless his heart, was full of excitement. “So, there are four colors! You’re the blue ones.”

My external voice was a masterpiece of calm appreciation. “Ah, cool. Blue.”

My internal voice was screaming into a pillow. *BLUE? Lorenzo, MY DEAR AND CHERISHED FRIEND, IN WHAT TACTILE UNIVERSE DOES A CONE FEEL ‘BLUE’? ARE THE OTHER CONES FEELING PARTICULARLY RED OR YELLOW TODAY? IS THIS A GAME OF SYNESTHESIA-BASED GUESSWORK?*

The final nail in the coffin was the board itself. It was a folding square of cardboard with raised lines indicating a path. So far, so good. But then Lorenzo began to read the rules.

“Okay, so you start on the purple square,” he began. My fingers found no purple square. There were no textural differences between the squares at all. “And if you land on a ‘Warp Zone,’ you get to jump to the matching ‘Warp Zone’ on the other side of the board.”

I felt a wave of profound existential despair wash over me. The game was not inaccessible. It was anti-accessible. It was a stunning monument to an idea of accessibility, constructed without a single thought for its actual use. It was a gift that said, “I thought about your blindness for the thirty seconds it took me to add this to my online shopping cart.”

“And the best part,” Lorenzo said, his voice reaching a fever pitch of genuine delight, “is that we can play it right now!”

This was the checkmate. I was cornered by the sheer, overwhelming force of his kindness. I couldn’t tell him his thoughtful gift was a useless piece of condescending plastic.

So I did what any of us would do. I placed my hand on the board, tracing one of the meaningless raised lines. “You know what,” I said, my voice full of soft, calculated regret, “I’m actually a little wiped today. Can we play it next time? I really want to be able to give it my full attention.”

“Oh, yeah, of course, man!” he said, completely understanding.

The game now sits on my shelf. I have not touched it since. It is my own personal museum exhibit, a shrine dedicated to the heavy, awkward, and often hilarious burden of a gift horse whose mouth, upon closer inspection, is full of absolute nonsense.
