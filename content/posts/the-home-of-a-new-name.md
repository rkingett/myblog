Mood: Like finding a bird that can finally sing.

The morning felt like a bruise. Not the sharp, immediate kind, but the dull and aching throb that settles into your bones and makes the air feel smothering.

I canceled all my accessibility meetings for the morning. I didn't have the bandwidth to explain-for the millionth time-why you should label a button or why you should make your menu navicable by keyboard or use HTML instead of a DIV. I just wanted the safety of my own noise.

The phone rang, shaking me out of my recrimination.

The synthesized voice of my screen reader announced her name. Her *old* name. For a heart stopping second, I almost let it go to voicemail. I didn't think I had anything to give. I answered.

Her voice was tight, like a wound violin string about to snap. She told me she had something very important to tell me.

I gave her my full attention. "I'm listening," I said.

I meant every word. I put down everything I was holding, sat on my bed, and became an ear.

"you're the only person I feel safe telling this to," she said, and that washed away the lingering knots of a harsh and brutal morning.

"Robert. I'm a woman."

and then, we cried together.

We cried for the sheer, terrifying, bravery of it. We cried for our hearts constantly trying to find a beacon of light in a world that wants to grind down our souls until we're echoes of lives. We cried for laws written by people that never had to fight to live in a society in their own skin. We cried for the harshness of the media, the world, and bigots that want to see us snuffed out because they're afraid of lives that aren't like them.

But then, the tone of the conversation changed. The tension left our souls.

"So," I said, wiping my face, my voice thick. "Does this mean I have to come out as pansexual now? Since, you know, we dated?"

There was a beat of silence, and then she laughed. It was a wet, shaky sound at first, but it grew into a real, chest-deep laugh. "I guess so," she said. "Surprise."

We spent the next hour reconstructing the world. We talked about name's. We spent the hour trying on names like coats, testing the weight and warmth of them. She wanted a name that sounded distinctive, a name that felt like *her* at long last.

Eventually, I tried one. "How about Coco?"

"Coco," she whispered.

I repeated it. *Coco.* It has a rhythm to it. Two hard, crisp beats followed by round, open vowels. It tastes like hot chocolate-warm, sweet, and comforting. It sounds like a heartbeat.

"It sounds like you," I said.

She loved it. For now, she is Coco.

We told each other "I love you" before hanging up, changing both our lives.

When we hung up, the headache was gone. The apartment didn't feel heavy anymore. It felt like a home where a new truth had just been spoken for the first time. The world outside is still loud, and it is still sharp, but in here, I know the sound of her real name. And that is enough to keep going.
