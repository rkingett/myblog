We are gathered here today to mourn a loss. Not of a person, no, but of a future. A future that was buttery, soft-centered, and studded with semi-sweet chocolate chips. A future that was stolen from me.

The evening had started with so much promise. His name was Leon, and his voice was a low, comfortable rumble that made the air in my small apartment feel warmer. The date was going well. The conversation flowed, a smooth, easy current. Hope, an emotion I usually keep locked in a very small box, had begun to rattle its cage. It felt, for a moment, like the world was a place of gentle possibility.

"I'll be right back," I said, getting up to use the bathroom. The floorboards creaked with my optimism.

In my kitchen, on the countertop, sat The One. It was in it's package, and It was the last of a batch I purchased with magical money I rarely have, a perfect specimen of a chocolate chip cookie. Not a crunchy, brittle disk, nor a pale, doughy tragedy. This was a masterpiece. I had been saving it. You don't just *eat* a cookie like that. You curate a moment for it. You earn it. It was my reward for surviving the week, my planned ten minutes of pure, uncomplicated joy.

I returned from the bathroom, the warm hum of Leonâ€™s presence still filling the living room. I walked to the kitchen counter, my fingers anticipating the familiar, slightly yielding texture of my prize.

And then, the investigation began.

My hand found the countertop. It then found the packaging. Inside, I felt... Nothing! It was cool. And smooth. Too smooth. A chilling, uninterrupted expanse of ceramic. My breath hitched. I conducted a fingertip sweep of the perimeter. Nothing. A second, more frantic pass through the center. Still nothing.

Then, I found the only witness. A single crumb. A tiny, gritty testament to the crime. It was coarse, still bearing the memory of brown sugar and baked flour. It felt lonely. Abandoned.

The silence in the kitchen was suddenly immense. The air, which moments ago had been thick with possibility, was now a vacuum. The low hum of the refrigerator felt like a funeral dirge. The hope in my chest collapsed into a tiny, dense point of cold grief.

I turned slowly, the weight of this betrayal settling on my shoulders.

Leon was still on the couch. I could hear the soft sound of his breathing. The breathing of a monster. A beautiful, charming, deep-voiced monster.

My internal monologue was a full-throated, operatic aria of despair. *You fiend! You have devoured my future! You have consumed my one, pure, saved-for-a-rainy-day moment of bliss! A plague upon your house and your lineage!*

My external voice, however, managed to crawl out of my throat, small and tight. "Leon?"

"Yeah, man?" That warm, rumbling voice. Untroubled. Unaware of the sacrilege he had just committed.

I took a breath. "The cookie," I said, my voice as flat and empty as the packaging behind me. "The one in the package."

There was a slight pause. A rustle of fabric as he shifted. "Oh, yeah, my bad. That thing was calling my name, for real. Hope you don't mind."

Mind? Mind? *Mind?* I mind in ways that language has not yet evolved to describe. I mind on a spiritual, cellular, and existential level.

"It was," I said, choosing my words with the care of a diplomat negotiating a ceasefire, "my last one."

"Ah, shoot," he said, his voice coated in a casual charm that was both infuriating and, damn it all, still incredibly attractive. "It was just a cookie, though, right? Can't you just order some more?"

WHAT?

*Just a cookie.* The words echoed in the cavernous, empty space where my joy used to live. He didn't understand. He couldn't understand. He was a man who saw a cookie and ate it. I was a man who saw a cookie and saw a covenant.

This could not stand. The trust was broken. The foundation was cracked.

I cannot see Leon again. The damage is simply too profound.

Unless.

Maybe, just maybe, if he were to write a thousand-word, handwritten apology, single-spaced, detailing the specific virtues of that particular cookie. Maybe if he were to undertake a quest to find the baker and commission a new batch, delivering them on a velvet pillow while humming a song of contrition.

Or maybe, just maybe, if he could find me a dashing husband who understands the sacred theology of The Last Cookie.

A man can dream, can't he?
