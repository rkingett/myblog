Mood: Daring to hope that a man will read this and heed it like a religious text.

To You,

I don't know your name yet. I don't know the specific music of your voice. But I know that one day, you might perform an act of profound and sacred intimacy. You might hold my face in your hands.

I need you to know what this means.

For a face that's bled from knife wounds, from masculine fists punching it, from furious smacks of hatred, This is not a casual gesture. It is an act of care. When your hands, warm and steady, cup my jaw and your palms rest against my cheeks, you are not just touching me. You are building a sanctuary around my mind. You are creating a safe space where the world cannot harm me again.

And I am letting you do this. I am trusting you to build this pocket of safety and to maintain it.

You are building a wall against the chaos of the world. Your flesh becomes a filter, softening the sharp edges of the auditory world, muffling the noise. My entire universe shrinks to the small, safe, warm space between your two hands.

I need you to know that the prolonged pressure of your touch is a language. A firm, steady pressure says, "You are safe. I am here. I will not let anything harm you again." A gentle, exploratory touch says, "I am learning you. I am paying attention."

And I need you to know that I will learn you, too. I will learn the texture of your palms, the length of your fingers, the specific, unique warmth that your soul radiates. And I will trust it.

So when the day comes, and you feel the impulse to do this, I beg you to do it with intention. Do it with reverence. Because you are not just holding my head. You are holding my trust. You are holding my hope. You are holding all the fragile, broken pieces of me, and telling them they have found a safe place to rest. And I promise, I will do my best to be worthy of the shelter you build.
