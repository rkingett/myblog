Today is your birthday. It’s the day I allow myself to call you.

My thumb hovers over your name in my contacts, a name I will never have the heart to move to an "In Memoriam" list. I press the button. The phone makes no sound as it dials, but I can feel the silent, hopeful query travel out into a world that I know has no answer for it. It rings once. Twice. Then, the inevitable click, and the disembodied voice of the phone company invites me to leave a message. I never do.

I hang up. I go to my saved voicemails. There is only one. It’s from you. It’s the last one.

I press play.

The first sound is a half-second of hiss, the sound of compressed, empty space. It’s the sound of distance, of technology admitting its own limitations. And then, you’re there.

“Rob! Hey, it’s me.”

Your voice floods the quiet of my room. It’s not just a memory of a voice; it’s the thing itself, a perfect audio fossil. It has your specific cadence, that gentle upward tilt at the end of your sentences that always made everything sound like a happy secret. I can hear the smile in it. I can hear the low rumble in your chest that I remember feeling when I stood next to you. It is so real, so impossibly, tangibly present, that for a fraction of a second my entire body believes you are on the other end of the line.

The recording is twenty-seven seconds long. You were just calling to tell me you were running late. There’s the sound of a car door slamming in the background, a ghost of your environment. You laugh at something, a sudden, explosive burst of pure joy that starts in your belly and spills out into the world. It’s the sound of a life being lived fully.

And then, just before the line cuts, you say it. The last words you would ever say to me, delivered with the casual warmth that was your signature, as easy and natural as breathing.

"I love you, see you in a bit!"

The words hang there for an eternity packed into a single second. The sound of that “I love you” is not heavy or dramatic. It’s light. It’s thrown away, a thing so common between us that it required no ceremony. And that is what breaks me. It’s the sound of a promise made with no knowledge that it could never be kept.

The recording ends. The hiss returns, and then there is only silence. But it’s a new kind of silence. It’s the silence that follows an “I love you” that can never be returned. It is a profound, echoing void, a question that will hang in the air for the rest of my life.

I sit here, the phone still pressed to my ear, listening to the nothing that follows my heartfelt response. Every year I do this. I visit this ghost made of sound. I let it resurrect you for twenty-seven seconds so you can say you love me, just so I can feel the fresh wound of not being able to say it back to you before a hate crime took you away.

This voicemail is the kindest, cruelest thing I own. Happy birthday, my friend.

I love you, too.
