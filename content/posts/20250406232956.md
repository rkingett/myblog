It's late at night, and this is the obligatory how this is built blog post, partially because, in truth, I genuinely do have a lot of people to thank for this website. So, shall we get started?

Firstly, what's this site made out of?

HTML and Markdown, and then hosted on a server.

In all seriousness though, this website is the result of one static site generator, for now anyway.

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
- A Git backup storage thing. Far more reliable than the cloud, or someone else's computer. I know Git is someone else's computer, but I just don't have the energy to explain the differences at the moment.

I chose Eleventy because it appeared to be super flexible. This, of course, comes with it's own downsides, like how it's very unforgiving. By this, I mean it's error outputs aren't exactly clear, nor written well, so some detective work has to happen to figure out, as an example, exactly how many duplicate permalinks it's trying to create if one tag has a capital letter in it, and some error messages are just outright unhelpful.

But it's super flexible, and super fast!

The CSS is the result of two people.

[Melanie Kat.](https://melaniekat.com/) An all around utterly fantastic human being that built this CSS! Current pronouns are she/her, and I don't know exactly how I came across her website one day but [I was browsing her tech articles,](https://melkat.blog/) and, she appeared to be a fellow Luddite, like me, so I wanted to email her to see if she would help me with some CSS. I offered payment, of course, even though I couldn't pay professional rates. I think the CSS speaks for itself on this website so that's why you should hire her for all the tech jobs. We've both learned a lot about each other and she, in turn, learned even more about accessibility, which is always a win!

It's also always good to have another PenPal too! As I use social media less and less, it's good to keep these digital connections, me thinks!

[Josh Vickerson.](https://www.joshvickerson.com/) Really great web accessibility person and developer. Had a huge hand on making the site more evergreen and a whole host of other improvements.

[StarBreaker.](https://starbreaker.org/) I know his name is Mathew but just go with me. He helped make a MAKE file that made deployment far easier!

You know the expression it takes a community to raise a child? A community can also develop a blog, as well!

Hire them and pay them a shit ton of money. don't just hire them without paying a shit ton of money, pay them a shit ton of money!

Until next time, I hope you like the new website! Now I'm off to bed. Nobody wake me up, for any reason. Thank you!
