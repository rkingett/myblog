[I have written about hands before.](/posts/) I’ve written about them as weapons, as tools, as instruments of casual violence and clinical detachment. My memory is a museum of the hands that have done me harm, a collection curated by pain. The clenched fist that taught me the sound of bone meeting cartilage. The proprietary grip that dug bruises into my arm like angry purple thumbprints. The hand that held a lit cigarette. Those were hands that were closed, stories with the covers slammed shut, their intent hidden until the moment of impact.

But a fist is a hand that is hiding something. A hand that grips is a hand that is afraid of losing control. And lately, I find myself dreaming not of avoiding hands, but of finally being able to read one. I find myself dreaming of the opposite of a fist.

I dream of a man's open palm.

I long to know what it would feel like to explore another person’s soul through the geography of their hand. To have a man trust me enough to place his hand, palm up, into my own. Not for a handshake, not as a prelude to sex, but as an offering. An invitation. A silent agreement to let me read.

I would start by tracing the lines, not as a fortune-teller predicting a future, but as a cartographer mapping a past. The life line, the heart line—not as prophecy, but as the rivers of his experience, worn into his skin over time. I would feel their depth, their texture. Are they smooth or are they interrupted by the little tributaries of scars and callouses?

The story is in the texture. I want to feel the landscape of his work and his life. The calloused pads at the base of his fingers would speak of effort, of lifting heavy things, of resilience. They are not roughness; they are a record. They are the story of a man who has held on, who has built things, who has worked. And I would want to feel the contrast: the softer, more vulnerable skin of the palm itself, the parts protected from the world. The story of his strength would be written in the callouses; the story of his tenderness would be in the skin between them.

I would learn the temperature of his honesty. A hand that is warm and dry, radiating a steady, living heat—that is the hand of a man who is comfortable in his own skin, who has nothing to hide. A cold, clammy hand is a hand full of secrets and anxiety.

This exploration would be the most profound form of intimacy I can imagine. It is an act of radical vulnerability to let someone read you this way. To offer up your hand, palm open and unguarded, is to offer up your history. Your work. Your softness. Your scars. It is to say, “This is me. This is the map of where I have been. Read it. Know me.”

I ache for that. I ache to find a man who is not afraid to let me read his story. A man whose hands I could learn until I knew their geography better than my own apartment. A man whose hands have a history of building and holding and caring, not a history of breaking things.

I want to trace the map of a man’s life in his palm, and in doing so, trust that this is the same hand that will never be raised against me. A hand that will not be used to bruise me, or break me, or leave me hospitalized like so many other hands have done. It is a terrifying, beautiful hope. To find a hand that offers its map instead of its fist. A hand that has absolutely nothing to hide.
