Surprise! I have news! I’m publishing something new!

Actually, it’s two things. One is a contribution to the anthology [How to Save the World.](https://robertkingett.com/posts/6517/) I published a personal essay about my experiences becoming a penpal for prisoners.

The second is a book I’m super excited to share! [Pass the Salt](https://robertkingett.com/posts/6522/) is a nonfiction collection of personal essays about the dating experience in Chicago in the 2010s.

Pass the Salt is funny, heartwarming, touching, and it’s just a snapshot of goodness. I hope you all really enjoy the book!

The best page to keep up with book formats and where to get it is on [this book landing page.](https://robertkingett.com/posts/6522/) As formats become available, I’ll put them here.

Stay tuned because lots of interviews are coming about the book and my overall experiences. I’m so happy to finally release this out into the world!
