I have been kissed before. I want to be clear about that. My lips have been met by others. But I am not sure I have ever had *a kiss.*

The kisses I have known were acts of punctuation. They were periods, used to end a negotiation. They were exclamation points, used to punctuate a moment of conquest. They were ellipses, trailing off into an unspoken demand. They were always, always monologues. An act of taking, of silencing, of a pressure that had nothing to do with affection and everything to do with closing a deal.

They were just a means to an end. They were like foreshadowing as to how the guy would take advantage of my vulnerability  later.

I have been trying, in the quiet of my own mind, to imagine what a different kind of kiss would be like. A kiss that is not a monologue, but a conversation. A kiss that is not a transaction, but a discovery.

I think it would start not with the lips, but with a hand.

It would be a hand on my face, a gesture I have learned to fear more than any other. But this hand would be different. It wouldn't be a prelude to bruises or hospitalization. It wouldn’t be a grip of possession or a clinical inspection. It would be a question. The palm would be warm, the touch gentle, cupping my jaw with a firmness that says “I am here,” but a lightness that says “I will leave if you need me to.” The thumb would stroke my cheek once, a soft, inquiring gesture. It would be asking for permission in a language older than words.

And the approach would be slow. I wouldn’t feel a sudden rush, but a gradual closing of the space between us. I would feel the warmth of his body, smell the clean, simple scent of his skin, feel the air change with his proximity. I would feel his breath, a soft, warm presence, before I ever felt his lips. A moment of shared atmosphere, a silent acknowledgement that we are about to enter a space together.

The kiss itself… it wouldn't be about passion. Not the kind you see in movies, which always looks like a battle. It would be about peace. The pressure would be soft, a gentle landing. It would be a touch that listens. A touch that is not trying to take anything, but is simply asking to be felt. It would be a question: Are you here with me?

My answer wouldn't have to be a grand gesture. It would be a slight softening of my own lips, a tiny tilt of my head. A quiet, physical response that says, Yes. I am here.

It would be a conversation. A slow, quiet back-and-forth of gentle pressures. A shared moment of discovery. This is me, his touch would say. This is my shape, my warmth, my presence. And my touch would say back, And this is mine. It would be the first time I felt like an equal participant in such an act, not just the silent venue where it took place.

And then there would be the aftermath. This, I think, is the most important part. The kisses I have known were followed by a cold, abrupt vacancy. The sound of someone else’s needs being met, followed by the silence of being discarded.

But this kiss, this conversation, would be followed by a different kind of silence. The silence of a forehead resting against mine. The feeling of his hand still warm on my cheek. The sound of our breathing, slowly syncing into a shared, peaceful rhythm. It would be a silence that wasn't empty, but full. A silence that held the echo of the conversation we just had.

It would be a silence that says, “That wasn't the end. We are still here. Together.”

I do not know if a kiss like that exists in the real world, outside of my own lonely imaginings. A kiss that gives more than it takes. A kiss that feels not like being used, but like being found. But I hold onto the blueprint of it in my heart. It is a fragile, heartbreaking hope, but it’s mine. And it’s the one thing no one has ever been able to take from me.
