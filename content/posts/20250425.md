I'm mainly keeping this for myself, but I'm also publishing this so I can have an easy, curated, directory of criticism against [the popular Blogging platform Substack.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack)

You might be wondering, why did you just call it a Blogging platform? That's because that's exactly what it is. It's making money off of combining two decentralized technologies. RSS feeds, and email. [It's doing absolutely nothing different than all the other Blogging platforms out there.](https://kingettlinks.bearblog.dev/tech-internet-and-blog-related-resources/)

I've never had a Substack. Years ago, I thought about syndicating my stuff to it, but not anymore. Unless I can import my RSS feed, I'm not interested in syndicating elsewhere. If I have to pick and choose what gets sent where instead of just plugging in my RSS feed and my stuff gets mirrored, that's not syndication. That's curation.

I can't really say anything more negative about Substack that other people haven't said below, other than their accessibility has always been utter garbage too, but that doesn't shock me in the slightest. All venture backed things are designed to make money from you, eventually, and if things just happen to be accessible, such as in the case of Microsoft, for example, it's just a means to an end. It's not a goal nor a mission for them.

Of course, open source still has community and accessibility problems too but that's for a different blog post, sometime down the line.

But without further ado, here's a giant list of criticism against Substack. But wait,

why do I hate Substack so much?

It's not that I hate it, per say. [I just find Substack exploitative and people don't realize how exploitative it really is.](https://buttondown.com/thehypothesis/archive/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so-well/) Not only that, I just find the platform extremely useless [when Blogging platforms exist that do what they do, but better.](https://kingettlinks.bearblog.dev/tech-internet-and-blog-related-resources/)

[The platform also hates minorities and wants people to be free to hate minorities too.](https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/substack-freedom-of-expression-and-tolerance-for-the-intolerant/index.html)
