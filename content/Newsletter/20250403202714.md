<p>Hi everyone! As you can see from reading this newsletter/email/post, everything is as working as it should be, and then some!</p>

<p>It took a while to get here, but we finally got here!</p>

<p>Now things should just work as usual. I write stuff, you read stuff, and send me some wonderful cookies in return.</p>

<p>Because of the website work this month, I haven't been doing a lot of reading but I have been diving into a few fiction podcasts.</p>

<p>One of these is <a href="https://www.theend.fyi/shows/academy">Academy,</a> a New Adult Romance/drama about a college with a whole lot of secret underbellies and I'm loving every minute of it.</p>

<p>The other is <a href="https://www.theend.fyi/shows/the-royals-of-malibu">The Royals of Malibu,</a> based off <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/77/9780593642139">the Paper Princes by Erin Watt's</a> and I don't know how to take the podcast yet. It starts off interesting but the many, many, ads take me out of the story. I don't even know why this fiction podcast has so many ads.</p>

<p>Other than that, I've been eagerly awaiting the release of <a href="https://compassiviste.com/product/pass-the-salt/">the Pass the Salt audiobook!</a> I'm really glad I chose Kevin R Free to narrate the book!</p>

<p>Lastly, the final thing I've been doing so far is I've been sending my snail mail pals lengthy letters about what it was like growing up in
FL where Christmas was 90 degrees.</p>

<p>Until next time, you all! So happy everything is working as
it should be!</p>
