Hi all, yes, I know, it's not the end of the month, again, but I'm knee deep in a lot of things, including doing some accessibility consulting for a videogame I can't talk about because of NDA.

First, short update. The [Pass the Salt](/posts/6522) audiobook has been delayed a little bit, but it's still coming! Reviewers will get advanced listener copies in May.

This month, readers, but especially Walden, have been suggesting the Murderbot series to me because I guess that's what Kevin is famous for? I've been hearing all about [the Murderbot TV show by Apple](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/murderbot/umc.cmc.5owrzntj9v1gpg31wshflud03) and, everyone said since Kevin R Free will be narrating Pass the Salt, I should really try the Murderbot diaries!

The first reader that recommended it to me though is a reader of this list! Hello, Walden. I'm reading it! I'm liking it! I haven't finished it yet. There's apparently two versions of the audiobook. [The Full Cast Graphic Audio version](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/10103215) and [the version made by Recorded Books with Kevin as the narrator.](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/3783062) Both are fun!

In other news,

I've been finding a lot of things about the old internet this month. One thing in particular came about because I was looking for something else about YouTube and [Chocolate Rain came up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwTZ2xpQwpA)

I didn't know this at the time, but [Chocolate Rain went mega viral.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_Rain) What's even stranger is people actually thought it was about getting pooped on, literally, instead of about racism and being a Black man in America. Some thought the song was comedy? There must be some visual gag I'm missing to the video because I don't get where the comedy is, and I have an egregiously fucked up sense of humor! I do love the guy's voice though! Now that's a voice I'd want to have reading Romance novels!

and as for what I'm listening to outside of books? More fiction podcasts! In particular,

[Theater of Heals](https://www.theend.fyi/shows/theatre-of-heels) about a girl that's a getaway driver for villins.

and finally, [this historical fiction podcast about the 2024 US election, made far before 2024.](https://www.theend.fyi/shows/it-happened-here-2024) Scary how accurate it was!

Until next time, everyone! Toodles, for now!
