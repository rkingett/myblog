Short email today, partially because I'm doing some much needed resting, but also, because yesterday used a lot of my energy even though it was very fun!

[I had an interview with the Fireside Fedi folks,](https://audio.firesidefedi.live/@firesidefedi/episodes/robert-kingett-accessibility-in-the-fediverse) about, well, honestly, a lot of topics, so you can watch and or listen to the interview below!

Until next time, toodles!
