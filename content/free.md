# How to get my work for free.

I'll often publish [the writings and stories](/posts) for free on this website to read but there are other ways to get [my books](/books) and or [my other writings](/writings) for free.

The easiest way is to [register to my mailing list on this page](/follow) and you can get all the books for free and anything else you want for free. All you have to do is ask. Just reply to a mailing list email, directly to me, not the comment email, and tell me what book you want and what format you want and I'll send it to you probably the next day. I'm doing all this manually so if I don't reply within a few days [reach out to me](/contact) and I'll check to make sure you are on my mailing list. If you are, you'll get a free copy.
