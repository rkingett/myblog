I am an expert screen reader user who has both advocated and consulted for companies making their services or products accessible.

I do extensive accessibility and usability testing. There’s a wide array of computer needs out there. Just because something is accessible does not mean everybody can use it without confusion. I take both into account when a company asks me to test for them.

## Expert accessibility witness.

I am often asked to contract with many lawyers and law firms to become an expert witness for accessibility related cases. Below are the firms and individuals I contract with regularly.

I’ve helped win many cases without going to trial.
