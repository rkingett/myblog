## Street Team links and info

[Join my street team](https://buttondown.com/weirdwriter?tag=beta&tag=free&tag=street) Read more about the exclusive content and duties on this page.

Joining my street team will give you the opportunity to get exclusive content while promoting me, or [my work,](/writings) in return.

[A street team is vital to an author’s success](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_team) because it’s rare that a publisher will help writers promote their books. A street team isn’t limited by location, either, so this means you can join from anywhere in the world.

Street teams appeal to me because I get to offer many exclusive things to a supportive group of fans willing to team up and promote me or my work in their respective locations.

I love community driven PR campaigns. Aside from the exclusive content, my street team is also a good way to meet people and network with other team members near you.
