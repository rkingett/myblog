# About the newsletter.

Even though you can <a href="/feed.xml">Follow the main RSS feed</a> not everyone uses RSS, so I offer a newsletter.

My newsletter has two kinds of emails.

1. Singular emails. These are usually announcements, things I found fun or interesting in one update every month or so, and or calls to beta read or get one of my things to review. They'll also include podcast releases.
2. Roundups. These are just collections of posts I do every month. The frequency can change, depending on what my readers want.

What can I say? I love writing on my website, and the frequency would be far too much if I had all those posts go out one by one, so I make roundup emails so people can click on a post they want to read when they feel like it.

[My newsletter is also how people can support me.](https://buttondown.com/weirdwriter) I offer pay per post, so, this means, you set a price, I post something, you get charged however amount you set. You can also set limits in case I post too much in one month. This way is the best way because there's no pressure on either me or you.

# How to get my work for free.

I'll often publish [the writings and stories](/posts) for free on this website to read but there are other ways to get [my books](/books) and or [my other writings](/writings) for free.

The easiest way is to register to my mailing list on this page, or [register on this follow page,](/follow) and you can get all the books for free and anything else you want for free. All you have to do is ask. Just reply to a mailing list email, directly to me, not the comment email, and tell me what book you want and what format you want and I'll send it to you probably the next day. I'm doing all this manually so if I don't reply within a few days [reach out to me](/contact) and I'll check to make sure you are on my mailing list. If you are, you'll get a free copy.
