This page holds links to learn about visits as well as watch presentations and keep up with future events.

I can have virtual or in person events. All of my events must have Live human captioning, CART services, and sign language interpretation.

I love doing events, even though I have a stutter. I’m available for live lit events, especially charity live lit shows, keynote speaking, or doing an author visit.

[My writing](/writings) is geared to a mature young adult or adult audience. Because of the disabilities, I’ll require a reader for live lit events.

## Important event links.

I require all of my events to have sign language interpreters and live human captions. I have many Deaf fans.
