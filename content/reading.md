I’ve worked with many publishers, corporations, and independent creators as an authenticity editor, formerly known as sensitivity reader. I can do, either, fiction consulting or Corporate DEI Consulting.

For manuscripts, I am available for authenticity edits throughout the year for all completed manuscripts. Rates start at $500 per manuscript of 80K words or less for middle grade/YA, and $750 per manuscript of 100K words or less of Adult fiction. Rates are negotiable above those word counts, and any fiction genre is open for a read.

All reads come with in-line edits/suggestions, as well as a summary document, and I will only accept a read if I have the time to turn it around in forty (40) days.

## Corporate DEI Consulting

Consultations and reviews of internal and external DEI statements, policies, Human Resources documents, and training materials according to modern equity and inclusion language standards. Essentially a corporate sensitivity read.

Corporate Consulting rates: Determined by on size and scope of the project. Minimum $600 for Corporate Day Consulting.
