## Synopsis.

> Could you survive a month without the internet?
>
> Robert Kingett didn’t think he could—until a friend dared him to try.
>
> The catch? Robert is blind, and he relies on the internet for everything. For thirty days he must use no Google. No social media. No online banking, shopping or job hunting. Ultimately, no digital shortcuts to help him navigate a world that’s already built to ignore people with disabilities.
>
> But as a journalist who advocates for accessibility, he knows this is a project that might just make a difference for the thousands of Disabled people across the country who still don’t have adequate access to the internet—and who face additional and unnecessary struggles as a result. And what begins as a personal challenge quickly becomes a radical social experiment.
>
> In his month off the grid, Robert encounters a whole host of challenges, both expected and unexpected, but also finds himself rediscovering, relearning and reconnecting in ways he never saw coming.
>
> Funny, eye-opening, and deeply human, this memoir is more than a story of digital withdrawal—it’s a bold wake-up call for improved Disability accessibility, inclusion, and the right to connect. Because being offline shouldn’t mean being left behind.
