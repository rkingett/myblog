# Podcasts I listen to.

I'm glad You've stumbled onto my Podroll page.

[Go here if you're looking for my podcast.](https://weirdwritings.pinecast.co/)

I love---and let me repeat this again---love, podcasts.

They aren't locked to an ecosystem despite everybody in the tech and publishing industry hating this fact. Tech and publishers and producers can't stand the fact they operate on protocols rather than platforms and I love podcasts because of that, but there's other reasons I love the medium.

You don't have to pay for podcasts. You don't have to be locked into one app. Because I have physical disabilities, podcasts are a fantastic way for me to rest and learn at the same time. I can just lay in bed and listen. Podcasts also must contain audio description by design. Otherwise, sighted people won't know what's happening either. Sighted people are limited by the audio medium and this means they don't have an advantage over me.

My tastes are split between fiction podcasts and nonfiction podcasts.

## Fiction podcasts.

I find my favorite fiction podcasts using [The End audio fiction directory](https://www.theend.fyi/shows/bonnie-screws-up) or [this audio drama directory that looks like Wikipedia.](http://www.audio-drama.com/doku.php/wiki/tag/narrated)

Typically, I listen to fiction podcasts more than nonfiction podcasts.

The styles of audio fiction I listen to vary quite a bit, but I tend to gravitate toward [fiction podcasts that center around relationships](https://www.theend.fyi/collection/love-is-in-on-the-air) or [smaller storylines that are slice of life,](https://www.theend.fyi/collection/reality-check) or [intimate tellings of events or themes,](https://www.theend.fyi/collection/comedy-gold) think a superhero show that focuses on how the superhero keeps friends when the friends feel small because they're saving the world every week. [I also enjoy podcast audiobooks as well.](http://www.audio-drama.com/doku.php/wiki/tag/narrated)

Even with those pulls toward relationship based audio fiction, I'll generally try any fiction podcast once if I like the trailer or first episode or synopsis.

[LeVar Burton Reads.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/levar-burton-reads/id1244649384)

Fun fact---one of my Fiction stories almost made it onto this podcast. LeVar Burton, my forever parasocial husband, reads short stories. Enough said. The podcast ended years ago but still, you won't be disappointed.

[Forever Yours.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/forever-yours/id1780403839)

Forever Yours, a love story that transcends time... Follow the written journey of a handsome and witty soldier and an aspiring baker, in the midst of the Korean War. Set in the Jim Crow south, the two share their captivating love story across oceans with weekly love letters. Together they learn that distance cannot erase the shared prejudices they face as African-Americans. Listen to Forever Yours, a new romantic fiction podcast brought to you by Well Writers Audio.

[Love and Luck.](https://www.loveandluckpodcast.com/)

Love and Luck is a fictional radio play podcast, told via voicemails and set in present day Melbourne, Australia.  A slice of life queer romance story with a touch of magic, it follows the relationship between two men, Jason and Kane, as their love grows both for each other and their community.

[Gay Pride and Prejudice.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gay-pride-prejudice/id1688736369)

In this modern interpretation of the Jane Austen classic, Bennet, a 30-something, non-committal gay man struggles to find belonging when his chosen family suddenly begins coupling up and settling down.

[Margaritas & Donuts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/margaritas-donuts/id1482406262)

Josephine, a pediatrician, is pretty unlucky romantically. With a little coaxing from her best friend Katrina, Josephine starts a relationship with Malik, an ophthalmologist that works in the office across the hall from hers. Malik is exactly what Josephine needs, but she doesn't quite realize it...yet.

[Childish: The Podcast Musical.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/childish-the-podcast-musical/id1469927749)

Dante, a college student in NYC, becomes an RA in order to follow in the footsteps of his hero, Childish Gambino. While he hopes this will be the next step toward becoming a famous rapper, his delusions of grandeur are shattered when he realizes his dweebish co-workers are hellbent on making his life miserable.

[DEM TIMES](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dem-times/id1533961755)

A trouble maker in high school, Samuel finds himself on a plane heading to Ghana; a different country, needless to say, a different life. His formative years have begun. These are 'DEM TIMES'. The show is in the broader sense, a serialised teen odyssey, set within the closed-off microcosm of Ghanaian boarding school life. At its core, this is a cultural migration; a fish-out-of-water story stemming from an outsider's identity crisis inside the Ghana educational ethos -- where the school day begins before sunrise and ends after 9pm, and only after students have finished their homework (assuming chores have been completed too).

[Fan Wars: The Empire Claps Back.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fan-wars-the-empire-claps-back/id1451033755)

Two passionate Star Wars fans on opposite sides of the Last Jedi debate argue via Skype after their favorite forum closes down. If you love Star Wars (or call yourself a proud member of any fandom), you'll love this romantic comedy told via conversations.

[Bonnie Screws Up](https://www.theend.fyi/shows/bonnie-screws-up)

Bonnie Martinez - a talented actress starring in a popular mystery web series called Special Cases. She's torn between the career plan her manager has designed and her desire for a life away from the cameras. And maybe a relationship with a regular guy like the cute bartender Bonnie has been stalking on social media for over three months, Duante Smith. All it takes is some liquid courage after another failed date with a Hollywood producer for Bonnie to screw up in a completely unplanned way: she breaks her Non-Disclosure Agreement for Special Cases. Bonnie is in a race to fix her mistake before it costs her everything.

[The Bright Sessions and the AM Files.](https://www.thebrightsessions.com/)

The Classic of audio fiction. It's still great, to this day. Superheroes go to therapy and deal with slice of life drama as well as other non powered and supernatural happenings.

## Nonfiction podcasts.

The nonfiction podcasts I listen to are rarely podcasts where people sit and talk to each other at a table, which makes up the bulk of podcasts today. I like audio storytelling. I like podcasts with a lot of production in them. I like podcasts that read print or the web out loud in any form. I don't find a lot of value in the popular talk show style podcasts unless there's a very particular theme surrounding the podcast, such as them reading a book chapter by chapter in part one of the episode and then discussing it in part two of the episode.

[The Guardian's Audio Long Reads.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-audio-long-read/id587347784) Narrated versions of their lengthy articles.

[This American Life.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/this-american-life/id201671138)

Narrated journalism that started it all, I think. Has intimate stories, zooms in on issues and creates stories out of them that have a beginning, middle, and an end.

[If Books Could Kill.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/if-books-could-kill/id1651876897)

Hilarious podcast where the hosts painstakingly read the books I don't want to read and then validate my feelings with their snark about the book or articles in question. They cover more topics now but the original tagline was, The airport bestsellers that captured our hearts and ruined our minds.

[Reveal.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/reveal/id886009669)

One of the best audio narrative journalism podcasts to date. Does deep dive investigations into many things and deliver gripping stories about caregivers, advocates for the unhoused, immigrant families, warehouse workers and formerly incarcerated people, fighting to hold the powerful accountable.

[This is Love](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/this-is-love/id1337100398)

A show that centers relationships in all it's forms, and showcases their stories.

[Modern Love.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/modern-love/id1065559535)

Mainly sharing this for the earliest episodes, the better ones. The earlier episodes were some of the best adaptation of writing I've ever seen. I don't like their newer episodes so if you can find older episodes, do so. They are far better. The earlier episodes had actors reading some of the most powerful writing on relationships I've ever seen. The newer episodes try to be ear candy and focus less on reading actual words. Bletch.

[How to be a Girl.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-be-a-girl/id891002592)

An intimate exploration of a mother learning to live with her Trans daughter and exploring gender.

[This is Actually Happening.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/this-is-actually-happening/id497227384)

What if you were trafficked into a cult...or were mauled by a grizzly bear...or were stabbed 27 times by a serial killer - what would you do? This is Actually Happening brings you extraordinary true stories of life-changing events told by the people who lived them. From a man who woke up in the morgue to a woman stranded in a Mexican desert fighting to survive, these stories will have you on the edge of your seat waiting to hear what happens next.

[Embedded.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/embedded/id1091709555)

A very good in-the-weeds series going deep on specific issues---from police departments to the military to political campaigns. NPR reporters embed themselves in institutions and communities for weeks or months, returning with intimate, complicated portraits that resist easy narratives.

## Audio Let's Plays.

Before my list, [here's another list of audio Let's Play podcasts](https://spilledpotion.com/uncategorized/the-audio-only-lets-play-and-bookclub-style-podcast-game-list/) [Archive for the previous list](https://archive.is/EqHl2) but many of the links in this post are broken, but it's still worth exploring.

Also, if you don't like video games but love tabletop games, [listen to people playing tabletop games too](https://audiodrama.directory/category/role-playing/)

I intentionally wrote about the below podcasts in the past tense, partially because I'm lazy and all podcasts end at some point.

I also explain which ones provide audio description, describing what's happening for the listener.

1. [RSS Sightless Scribbles, my podcast,](https://pinecast.com/feed/weirdwritings) showcased audio games and games with built in audio description.

1. [Gorilla's playthroughs.](https://gorillasplaythrough.wordpress.com/) [RSS for Gorilla's playthrough.](https://anchor.fm/s/8c17098/podcast/rss) Provides audio description for games and even describes the menus sometimes. Shockingly, my sighted friends loved the audio description touches in this podcast because it's absolutely meant for audio since it's made with blind listeners in mind.
1. [Hello Hyrule: A Legend of Zelda Travelogue.](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/hyrulepod/) [Feed for Hello Hyrule: A Legend of Zelda Travelogue.](https://anchor.fm/s/4d37231c/podcast/rss)Played through all the Zelda games and also provided audio description and reads off dialog.

They branched out to other games, but their back catalog focused primarily on Dragon Age.
1. [RSS Play Along Podcast.](https://anchor.fm/s/4a216228/podcast/rss) Another traditional Let's Play style, but they focused a lot on indie games, which I loved! They'd sometimes provide audio description but mostly it was commentary and discussion.
