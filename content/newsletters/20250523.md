Hi all, yes, I know, it's not the end of the month, again, but I'm knee deep in a lot of things, including doing some accessibility consulting for a videogame I can't talk about because of NDA.

First, short update. The [Pass the Salt](https://compassiviste.com/product/pass-the-salt/) audiobook has been delayed a little bit, but it's still coming! Reviewers will get advanced listener copies at the end of June or, just to be safe, early July.

I haven't really been doing a lot of media things this month, but here's some things I did watch and or check out.

[This podcast episode talks about an event scandal in the book world](https://audioboom.com/posts/8718308-243-the-worst-scam-we-ve-ever-covered-a-million-lives-book-festival) and, honestly, I'm a sucker for these kinds of mishaps.

Fellow authors, I beg you! Hire an event planner! Please! This is why I attend most events remotely. If shit goes wrong, I won't be stranded.

I watched, [Deaf President Now, with audio description of course,](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/deaf-president-now/) and that was fascinating seeing Disability history play out just before I was born!

I did try [the TV show MurderBot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murderbot_(TV_series)) but I couldn't get into it. Shame because I'm a sucker for this exact kind of show. I'll try again later.

I did get into watching [the Neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neighborhood_(TV_series)) and that's been really fun!

A reader gifted me [A Disability History of the United States](https://www.beacon.org/A-Disability-History-of-the-United-States-P1018.aspx) and I've been devouring that basically the whole month! Thank you!

# Small accomplishments.

I finished my first fiction podcast series! it's going to be produced by [CD Skipper productions.](https://web-cdn.bsky.app/profile/did:plc:gc5x2soxiaqkyzhpezoom5dj) [Girlfriend Material](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:yukhcyf37itiz774f4zj5ig2) is a romantic comedy where two women fall in love over repairing fabrics and moddeling. It's full of my witty banterish humor! It's very lighthearted, so if you want to have dark and gritty, this show isn't for you. I'll be looking for beta readers soon.

Off the Grid edits are turned in! [Sean Crisden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDNdUnUCPUA) can't record the audiobook until August 2025, so we're gunning for a 2026 release.

I wrote my first ever film screenplay, but it's basically 5 hours long at this point, whoops! If anybody wants to help trim this, beta read it or laugh at how long it is, [contact me](/contact/) or reply to this email if you're reading this in your email client.

That's all for May folks! Toodles, for now!
