Hi everyone! I missed June's roundup of links and stuff because I was busy doing, well, work! In short, I'm working on a bunch of projects.

One completed project is a Dracula Romantic comedy where Dracula stole Jonathan's Razer to see what this handsome man would look like with a beard, it's with the original person that inspired the book. They're beta reading it. I'll send it out soon after they had a chance to correct all my typos and such.

I'm also working on a bunch of stuff I've had in my trunk folder for a while. I figured, since my country has dissolved into a fascist country, what better way than to, quite literally, just check out, and dive into creativity and art. It has it's benefits! I, of course, haven't stopped reading news, but it's becoming harder, and harder, to survive and keep my surfaces when a good portion of my country would rather see services get cut because they don't like it when people get what they think are handouts.

I don't want to go into it all because, honestly? I don't have anything else to say. Our country has a bunch of problems. [Your support of me matters now more than ever because your financial support keeps me alive,](/support) and in this climate, staying alive is the most radical act I can do under the circumstances.

That being said, some short highlights!

My publisher said the pre order for Off the Grid will be live soon. Yay!

[I've been doing a lot of personal Blogging.](/posts) I'm treating my website as a place where my soul will live. It's not going to be just a public platform anymore. I want to have my soul rest here, so you'll get more raw, messy, posts.

## Media and otherwise recommendations.

Since July is Disability Pride Month, I'd like to highlight some books and blogs I've been reading to stay informed, or, to brush up on my Disability history.

[Disability Debrief](https://www.disabilitydebrief.org/) always has fantastic roundups.

[Curb Cuts has good Disability tech stuff](https://www.curbcuts.co/)
 Even though they are rarely critical of AI and tech in general.

[Libro FM featured some Disabled authors and audiobooks YAY!](https://blog.libro.fm/disability-pride-bookseller-recommended/)

A reader gifted me [A Disability History of the United States.](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/219258/a-disability-history-of-the-united-states-by-kim-e-nielsen/) Thank you!

[The Disabled Ginger](https://www.disabledginger.com/) is an international disability blog I read frequently.

Back to art, everyone! I can't thank you enough for all the support!
