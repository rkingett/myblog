Hi everyone! Can it be a running joke to where I say only one email this month then I have a bunch of updates all happening in the same month?

Bad news. My original domain, robertkingett.com, isn't pointing to the new website. I'm trying to get this fixed, but my initial host has stopped replying to emails and the like. I dunno when it will return. Working on it! This is why I need a husband so he can console me when my internet life goes to hell.

Good news,

Comradery is back up! If you were donating, though, unfortunately, you need to cancel the Comradery subscription then donate again at the link below!

Check out the page below. It is a cooperative Patreon alternative.
