Hi all, short update today!

As I am still doing things for the relaunch of Off the Grid and other things, the producers of Mortified emailed me to ask me if I'd be interested in having one of my shows be included in a special of theirs. Naturally, I said yes.

They released the episode, and you can [listen or download the episode here](https://play.prx.org/listen?ge=prx_36_ecdeb29b-6e00-4b06-b919-bd2336b7552e&uf=https%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.getmortified.com%2FMortifiedPod)

For my Deaf followers, [here is the video with captions and ASL](https://youtu.be/iy7wnZfat2Y?t=1469)
