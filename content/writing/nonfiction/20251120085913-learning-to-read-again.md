> Reading is essential for those who seek to rise above the ordinary. 

~Jim Rohn 

"I noticed something," my friend Ashley said. "Your bookshelf is empty." 

I nodded absently, listening to the various park sounds around us. Kids were running and laughing, the wind was blowing, and the sun was keeping a warm day bright. I could feel the sun on my face just as much as I could feel my best friend staring at me with concern. 

"I'm looking at your online bookshelf right now. It's clear of books this year. Why?" she asked. 

"I wish I could read, but I just don't have enough time," I replied, thinking about the many hours I'd spent, in the past month alone, helping someone with their computer or browsing online news articles instead of reading novels. 

"But, like, who's going to recommend fun books to me?" Ashley asked, sounding shocked. "You always were my book buddy. What happened?" 

"I don't know," I said. As if to reveal all my secrets, my iPhone emitted a high-pitched ding and then started reading off my next calendar event. 

"Help Tom with his computer. Two hours." 

"Well, there's your problem!" Ashley said excitedly. "Try to slot in some reading time." 

When I got home that day, I deleted a calendar event that was supposed to happen at 9:00 that night and typed into the description box, "Read a novel." 

When the event arrived, I felt so guilty that I hesitated to turn on the audiobook. With resolve, though, I pressed Play and sank into a cozy young-adult novel. I soon relaxed and noticed that I was genuinely enjoying myself. 

The next morning, I woke up a lot happier than usual. I usually woke up feeling like I didn't get enough sleep, like I'd never get enough sleep. That morning was different. My movements felt a lot smoother. I caught myself smiling as I ate cereal. I realized I was eager to get back into the story I was reading the night before. 

I had forgotten the excitement I used to have when I read on a regular basis. Throughout that day, a feeling of happiness came over me. I wanted to experience this feeling again in the future, so I called Tom at lunch. 

"Hey, Tom," I said. "I know I'm supposed to come over today, but I wanna stay home and read tonight. Is that okay?" 

"Of course," Tom replied. "Have a good time tonight." 

"You, too," I said. 

I spent the rest of the day doing something I hadn't done in years: clear my calendar for myself. Each time I put "personal time" in my calendar, I felt really happy. 

When it came time to read for the second night in a row, it was easier than the previous night. I even turned off my phone and sank into bed with headphones on. 

Then I turned my phone back on and called Ashley to tell her that I had canceled a lot of upcoming appointments. She was excited. "That's really great. My bookshelf is dwindling. I'm glad to have my book buddy back." 

"I'm glad to be back," I said. "Now I have to go. I need to finish this chapter."
