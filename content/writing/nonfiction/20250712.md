I hope to give this letter to a special man, one day.

I love you more than I love my books. Your cover is the one thing I look forward to each day. Your leather binding captivates my eye. Your words always keep me turning the pages, wanting more. I love the plot points you reveal to me when we are communicating. 

I can't find the words to describe my feelings when I pick you up and begin a new chapter. I love how there are so many verbs in your steps, so many adjectives in each syllable you utter, such deep metaphors in every unspoken thought. I love it when you show me striking flashbacks. 

Each night, I set a bookmark so the next morning I can pick up where I left off. Each time a chapter ends, I love turning back the pages to gaze one final time on what a splendid story we made together. 

When you make me feel the best I can feel, you are my romance novel. When you make me laugh out loud, you are my humor novella. When you tell me you love me and I know it's true, you are my short story. I look forward to dwelling in your pages, reading chapter after chapter each day. 

I never want to give you up. I never want to place your beautiful story back on the shelf to be replaced by some tragedy. You are, and forever will be, a best-seller in my eyes.
