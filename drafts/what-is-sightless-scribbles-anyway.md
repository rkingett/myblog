Mood: Exposed, defiant, and currently craving a very specific kind of ginger snap.

This is a simultaneous transmission. It is a tactile map of the engine room, a way to feel the hum of the machine while I’m typing. But for those of you stumbling onto this URL for the first time, wondering why the prose feels different—heavier, maybe, or just louder in the quiet parts—this is also an introduction.

As the readership grows, I realized I needed a manifesto nailed to the digital door. So, hi. Thank you for reading *Sightless Scribbles*.

What is this place? Technically, it’s a blog. Spiritually, it is the highest form of literary narcissism you will ever encounter. I say that because the world is loud. My anxieties are loud. The systems designed to crush disabled people are deafening.

I am a blind gay man living in a world obsessed with optics. Things happen to me—some good, some tragic, some absurdly funny. This blog is where I translate those raw, chaotic inputs into something you can hold. It is the ultimate immersion into my literary world, a place where I take the "visual" and dismantle it, brick by brick, until all that’s left is the truth of experiencing my non-visual world.

On this site, you will find [a smorgasbord of literary output.](/posts) You’ll find [fiction that explores the terrifying vulnerability of intimacy.](/tags/fiction) You’ll find nonfiction accounts of my daily wars with bureaucracy—[tales of how I outsmarted a hostile telephone tree](/posts/20250629) or [the specific, tactile joy of a perfectly designed doorknob.](/writing/nonfiction/20250626) You’ll find [writing exercises,](/tags/writing) [older journalism,](/tags/throwbacks) and [experiments in form.](/posts/)

You will also find such things as [praises for libraries,](/posts/20250910) [love letters to chocolate,](/posts/20250727) [hilarious tales of men I dated eating my cookies,](posts/20250806) and [letters to people I have yet to meet.](/writing/nonfiction/20250712)

But primarily, you will find the truth of my body.

I am a blind writer. Typically, I write Romance. I write it not as a guilty pleasure, but as a survival manual. In a world that tells disabled people we are burdens, Romance is the only genre that insists we are worthy of worship. It is a political act to write a story where safety is the ultimate kink.

For those who prefer to listen—because reading with your eyes is not the only way to consume a soul—[I have a podcast the same name as this blog](https://weirdwritings.pinecast.co/). This isn’t just a robot reading text. These posts are performed by professional and emerging voice actors. They bring a new kind of symphony to these words, adding breath, pause, and resonance to the text.

If you want the full experience, you can [support the podcast with a monthly subscription to get serialized versions of my audiobooks.](https://tips.pinecast.com/jar/weirdwritings) You will get a private RSS feed to use in any app.

I do this because I am a Sovereign User. I believe in the "Small Web." I loathe the walled gardens of audible-exclusive content and the pernicious creep of DRM (Digital Rights Management). If you buy a book, you should own the file. If you support an artist, the money should go to the artist, not a tech conglomerate. [By supporting the podcast financially](https://tips.pinecast.com/jar/weirdwritings), you help me pay the narrators, because artists deserve to eat.

Now, a warning about time.

I do not have a schedule. I never will.

I operate on CripTime. I reject the capitalist myth of "productivity" and "hustle culture." My body is an atlas of scars—physical maps of where the world has been too rough. I have Cerebral Palsy, and my energy is a finite, precious currency. The best thing I can do for my body, and for the quality of this work, is to refuse to be a machine.

This is especially true in the winter.

If you notice the feed slowing down when the temperature drops here in the United States, that is because the cold does unspeakable, violent things to my body. The winter nights here are long and heavy. The cold seeps into my joints and makes them scream with the veracity of a siren. Pain becomes a second pulse.

So, in the winter, I slow down. I retreat. I become the kind of person who wants nothing more than to spend the dark months buried under three weighted blankets, listening to an audiobook while a pair of safe, gay hands feeds me cookies.

That is the dream, anyway.

But even when I am slow, I am here. I write because this is my soul. This is my safe space on the internet. Here, I reclaim power through words. I examine the confusing, emotional toll of existing in this temporary video game we call life, and I offer it up to you.

I translate the complicated emotions so you can understand what life is like for me. If you want to [understand the reverence of having a man stand still as I worshipfully read the history of his life via the callouses on his open palm,]() or what I imagine when a partner holds my face to block out the noise of the world,](/posts/20251025) this blog is your key.

I do not make money on this blog. I do not take sponsored posts. I do not run advertisements that track your data. I never will. You are my only patron. If you want to ensure I can keep writing, keep paying narrators, and keep buying the heating pads that get me through January, [I need your financial support.](/support/)

Welcome. Thank you for reading. Thank you for slowing down enough to feel the texture of my world.

I promise, there is something here for everyone who is willing to close their eyes and listen.
