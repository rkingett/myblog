    <title>Introducing the BOOK</title>
    <link href="/myblog/posts/6514/" />
    <updated>2024-03-10T00:08:09Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe I came up with this in high school! I was digging around old flash drives and found this. Ironically, I think I captured the tech culture that plagues us today. If you show this to a tech bro, I wonder if his eyes will light up like a Christmas tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t know what I was going for back then, but if I were to write this today, I’d make some clearer jabs at tech lovers and tech enthusiasts, but all in all, I think I did well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-book&quot;&gt;The BOOK.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Robert Kingett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a new revolutionary piece of technology out there on the market today that can very much &amp;quot;expand&amp;quot; the lives of others. It is called the Brevity of Optical Knowledge, or it’s more common name, BOOK. The BOOK is very advanced when it comes to information storage. Compacting over 97,000 characters into its memory banks, the BOOK is a very easy to use and affordable piece of equipment packed with tons of features, maps, entertainment articles, and even some games from time to time, and it all fits in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOOK uses a special black symbol creator to display its information to the naked eye. With striking contrast yet clear precise type, the user will have no issues reading the information that is displayed on the bound viewing pad. Certain models of the Book have enlarged text so those with visual impairments or reading difficulties can easily decipher what’s on the viewing pad. This new character generator will make it easy to navigate the vast array of information stored within the BOOK’s memory. Many users will love the ease of access that the BOOK has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOOK can also display elaborate graphic designs, charts, and even graphs. It displays these graphical drawings precisely to scale on the view pad, and in some instances, the graphs are even color coded by a special optical generating device that allows the user to automatically receive the transmitted color coordinated information. Some models of the BOOK have tactile representations that pop out of the viewing pad for younger users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOOK is even portable. With dimensions of 6 x 9 inches for a new softly bound model or 8.5 x 11 for a hardbound model, the BOOK can be taken anywhere, and used anywhere. However, the user must use both hands to initialize the program within. The user must also be near some sort of light source to see the information the BOOK displays on its viewing pad. For those dark environments, the BOOK does offer audio-based versions so users can enjoy the program even without a light source, or when they are busy, or if they have trouble deciphering what’s on the viewing pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each model of the BOOK has a self-contained program that, when activated, will fire the powerful virtual reality neural network in the brain to give users an authentic reenactment experience as users decipher the code on the viewing pad or by listening to the audio model. Not all users of the BOOK will be able to use these virtual reality experiences because they’ve suppressed their imagination. Users with limited imagination will not be able to take full advantage of the virtual reality experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOOK has the ability to automatically show the viewer a sneak peak at what the particular package contains within. Displaying the information summery in a vertical column running down the left side of the preview screen before the program starts, users can quickly look and see what’s contained in the unit. It will even give the section so that users can quickly navigate to the proper point. This advanced indexing system isn’t available in all versions of the BOOK, but most packages offer this extra feature at no cost to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOOK even has an extension which will mark your place for you. The extension has munificent elaborate computer-generated designs that are easy to see and distinguish. This extension is commonly referred to as the BOOKMARK. Unlike imagination, the BOOKMARK is an accessory that is sold separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOOK is very affordable. With its vast array of information and features, most versions of the BOOK are available for a one-time price of &#92;$12.00 at most venders across the United States. Training may be required to use the BOOK, but the department of education has made it a law to allow all people regardless of disability, race, creed, sexual orientation, or religion to receive training for the BOOK. Training usually starts at about six years old, and training may speed or decrease depending on the user’s knowledge of the BOOK’s internal code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOOK is available in all major carriers across the world. You can even try the BOOK for a minimum of two weeks at certain testing facilities around the world created by adults that believe sharing is caring, which comes dangerously close to socialism, but you must acquire a card to be able to access these testing centers. Not everyone can impersonate a person, so we want to make sure that it is in fact, you, who wishes to test out the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers of the BOOK put a lot of time and effort into making the proper display, program, and casing. The BOOK is durable but handle the equipment with care. There isn’t a warranty available for the BOOK yet, but there is a money back guarantee option that you automatically get when at certain venders that carry the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOOK will be available everywhere, and this is a new piece of technology that you don’t want to miss. With clear precise lazar technology, images and texts are displayed on a nice white screen with black shading, an advanced navigation system, and an innovative user interface, the BOOK just may be the highlight of today. The BOOK will be released sometime this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Finally, there’s a comic book store for the blind.</title>
    <link href="/myblog/posts/6510/" />

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was published on Vice. It was a good journalism piece, I feel, even though I am no longer a journalist. Still, this was great because I got paid well above what I was expecting. It was my first publication where I negotiated my salary so it will always hold a special place in my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Vice is no more, enjoy this snapshot in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s a comic book store for the blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Robert Kingett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August 9, 2016, 6:33am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comics Empower sells and makes in-house audio adaptations of comic books for the blind and visually impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been blind since birth. Growing up, I devoured novels translated into braille and adapted into audio books, but there was never an equivalent for comic books. While my sighted friends were enjoying Batman and Spider-Man comics, I became complacent with hearing about them secondhand but never experiencing the stories for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I would discover companies like Audio Comics and Graphic Audio, which have produced audio versions of comics. But browsing the websites that sell their audio comics can be challenging when you’re blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is exactly why Guy Hasson created &lt;a href=&quot;http://comicsempower.com/&quot;&gt;Comics Empower,&lt;/a&gt; an online comic book store for the blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Comics Empower website was designed to put blind and visually impaired customers first by providing original and adapted audio comics produced in-house, plus audio comics produced by other companies. The store is completely accessible to the blind or visually impaired using a high-contrast display or a screen reader. On the contrary, sighted people who visit the store will need to use adaptive tools and techniques to navigate or ask a visually impaired person for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to Hasson to ask him about why he created the store and what he envisions as the future of comics for the blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VICE: Tell me about how you got into comics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guy Hasson:&lt;/strong&gt; I grew up in Israel. We didn’t really have any comics—not Spider-Man, not Superman. We just had two comics, which were both in black-and-white. One was &lt;em&gt;Tarzan&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t remember the other’s name, but it was kind of a &lt;em&gt;Tarzan&lt;/em&gt; rip-off, with adventures in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to the United States at age 11, the first thing I bought was a Spider-Man comic book. And that’s it, I was hooked. Three years later, I was in high school, and I’d go to the used comic book store two minutes away from the school at the end of every day, where I would pick up some kind of old, cheap comic book with my lunch money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vice: &lt;strong&gt;How did you come up with the idea of making a comic store for the blind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was running an indie comic book company called New Worlds Comics for a year and a half, when suddenly a thought came to me: &lt;em&gt;Why are there no comics for the blind?&lt;/em&gt; And then I figured out how to do it, how to translate everything to audio, how to build the website, how to create the store, and so on. In a month and a half, the website was up with a few comic books, just to see if they were done right. Once people reacted well to them, we were off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vice: &lt;strong&gt;But you’re not blind or visually impaired, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, and there was no one blind or visually impaired in my family or friends at the time who could have triggered this thought. There was no real reason for me to think of it. But once I had figured out how to do it, it was just a crime not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are literally tens of thousands of kids, teens, and adults out there who would love to read the same comic books their sighted friends are reading and to talk to them about it, without waiting for the friends or family to read the comics to them. By accident, it turned out to be one of the most important things I’ve done in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vice: &lt;strong&gt;Comics Empower has created its own in-house audio adaptations of comic books. What’s the difference between those and, say, Audio Comics or Graphic Audio adaptations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are really good productions. We actually sell Audio Comics productions at Comics Empower, and I hope that Graphic Audio will allow us to sell its comics as well. We’re a comic book store, not a comic book publisher—so anyone who creates great comic books can be sold at Comics Empower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, Comics Empower does create a lot of audio productions for comics, and we do it differently from Graphic Audio or Audio Comics. They have great productions with a big cast and music and they create, as they say, &amp;quot;a movie in your head.&amp;quot; Comics Empower, on the other hand, creates comic books with one actor per comic, and no music. We give the comic book experience, rather than a movie experience, going page by page, panel by panel, to give you the entire experience of reading a comic book in a way that keeps your interest going, start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a little poll after releasing Audio Comics, and it turned out that though people like both types, there was a large preference to the comic book experience rather than the movie experience. That actually surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vice: &lt;strong&gt;How did you decide to have panel descriptions and a single narrator?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how you read a comic book. There’s only one voice: the voice in your head. And you go page by page, and you go down each page from one panel to another, following the story, reading the speech bubbles, the captions, and so on. That’s the comic book experience I have, that everyone has, and that is the experience that’s inaccessible to so many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vice: &lt;strong&gt;What is your future outlook for blind comic book writers, and why do you think that way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve had two winners for the writing competition for a blind or visually impaired comic book writer. After all, now that you can read comics, there is no reason in the world you can’t write comics. And, indeed, there are two first-place winners because their writing was really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One comic, &lt;em&gt;Bakasura&lt;/em&gt;, is about a mysterious demon haunting a town in India. And the other, &lt;em&gt;Unseen&lt;/em&gt;, is about a blind assassin. Both are very different from each other, and both are very good. There is no reason that the writers, Pranav Lal and Chad Allen, can’t sell their comics to Marvel or DC, and maybe in the future get TV or movie deals. And there’s no reason other blind or visually impaired writers can’t do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where Home is Not Safe</title>

Between the subtitle, Writings on Domestic Verbal, Emotional and Physical Abuse, is a painted image of a two-story home on the right with chimneys and a high fence.  There is grass on the left of the home with a single-story home on the left side&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Home is Not Safe. Writings on Domestic Verbal, Emotional and Physical Abuse Edited by Judith Skillman and Linera Lucas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISBN: 9781476683928&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you haven’t been hurt by domestic violence, someone you know has and wishes they could tell you about it. Perhaps you are a therapist, teacher, academic, or social worker who wants to help those who are suffering. Or maybe you are in an abusive relationship and need to know that you are not alone. The poetry, memoirs, and creative nonfiction pieces collected here tell of real incidents of abuse, as well as of those who left destructive and unsalvageable relationships. The beauty and truth of the language, as well as the honesty and courage, set this anthology apart from self-help manuals and academic treatises on domestic violence. This book offers a path forward to healing, health and fulfillment, using the power of art to give voice where voice has been stifled, forgotten, overlooked or denied.&lt;/p&gt;
